ðŸ’¡This is a clone of the official website of UltraEdit, the text editor. I have developed it using pure HTML5 & CSS3. I have tried making it responsive too, though it's not fully responsive yet and can give errors at time on different devices, but based on functionality it works really well. I am continously working on pro responsive designs and shortly will achieve them for sure. Also, I am really close to integrate JavaScript in my projects as well. Meanwhile, you can download the various versions of UltraEdit text editor directly from the download button in my cloned website, without external redirection over to the original websiteðŸ˜‰

I hope you like itâš¡ Here's the original website for your reference and comparison:
